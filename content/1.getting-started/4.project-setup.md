description: A clean folder structure for events and commands (guide-style).

A music bot becomes messy *fast* if everything lives in one file. This structure keeps the code readable while staying beginner-friendly.

## Recommended structure

```txt
my-moonlink-bot/
├─ commands/
│  ├─ play.js
│  ├─ stop.js
│  └─ ...
├─ events/
│  ├─ ready.js
│  └─ messageCreate.js
├─ config.json
├─ index.js
└─ package.json
```

### Why this layout works

- `commands/`: one command per file.
- `events/`: one event handler per file.
- `index.js`: wires everything together (client + manager + loaders).

This is the same idea used by large Discord bot guides: keep files small and responsibilities clear.

## Create the folders

```bash
mkdir commands events
```
