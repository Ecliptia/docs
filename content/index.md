## amidst the hive üêù
<div style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #ccc;">
<p>i feel out of place<br>
amidst the beehive‚Ä¶<br>
they look at me<br>
with disapproval in their eyes ‚Äî<br>
as if they could see<br>
the secrets of my heart.</p>

<p>they say i am a rebel<br>
for not serving ‚Äî<br>
with devotion ‚Äî<br>
the queen bee.</p>

<p>but if i serve,<br>
what good will it do,<br>
if it is not what my soul<br>
has chosen to love?</p>

<p>i wish i could fly,<br>
free among the garden flowers,<br>
without worrying about returning ‚Äî<br>
to the place i no longer know how to inhabit.</p>

<p>but i believe that one day,<br>
i will break this prison,<br>
and i will finally be able to fly<br>
wherever i want ‚Äî<br>
with my own wings and<br>
my own direction.</p>
