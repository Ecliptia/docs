Before you touch any code, make sure the "plumbing" is ready. Most Moonlink problems are not code problems — they’re usually *missing intents*, *a wrong password*, or *a node that isn’t reachable*.

## Requirements

- **Node.js:** `v18.x` or higher.
- **discord.js:** v14.
- **An audio server:**
  - **NodeLink** (recommended), or
  - **Lavalink v4**.

::alert{type="note" icon="lucide:info"}
Moonlink.js is the *client*. It does not stream audio by itself — it controls a **NodeLink/Lavalink** server.

## Discord Developer Portal checklist

1. Create an application.
2. Create/enable the bot.
3. Copy the **token** (treat it like a password).
4. Invite the bot to your server.

### Required intents

For a prefix-command music bot, you usually want:

- `Guilds` (required)
- `GuildVoiceStates` (required for voice)
- `GuildMessages` + `MessageContent` (for reading `!play` style commands)

::alert{type="warning" icon="lucide:triangle-alert"}
If you read message content (prefix commands), enable **Message Content Intent** in the Developer Portal and in your code.

## Audio node checklist (NodeLink/Lavalink)

Before blaming the bot, verify:

- The node is **running**.
- Host/port/password are correct.
- If you use TLS, set `secure: true`.

::alert{type="success" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
Best practice: run **two nodes** (main + backup). Even for small bots, this saves you from downtime.
